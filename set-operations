 Set operations in SQL are used to combine results from two or more SELECT queries. The most common set operations are:

--UNION
--UNION ALL
--INTERSECT
--EXCEPT

    SELECT department FROM employees
    UNION
    SELECT department_name FROM department;

2.UNIION ALL:
  Use: Combines results from two SELECT queries and includes duplicates.
Example query:
    SELECT department FROM employees
    UNION ALL
    SELECT department_name FROM department;

3.INTERSECT:
  Use:Returns only the common rows between two SELECT queries.
Example query:
    SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees
    INTERSECT
    SELECT department_name FROM department;

4.EXCEPT:

Example query:
