1.CREATE VIEW:
  Use:A VIEW is a virtual table created by a SQL SELECT query. It doesn't store data but provides a way to simplify complex queries or restrict access to specific columns or rows.

Example query:
  CREATE VIEW sales_employees AS
  SELECT 
    id,
    CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name,
    salary,
    join_date
  FROM employees
  WHERE department = 'Sales';

  select * from sales_employees;

2.DROP VIEW:
  Use:Removes the view from the database.

Example query:
  DROP VIEW sales_employees;

3.ALTER VIEW:
  Use:Updates the definition of an existing view.

Example query:
  ALTER VIEW sales_employees AS
  SELECT 
    id,
    CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name,
    email,
    salary,
    join_date
  FROM employees
  WHERE department = 'Sales';

4.INSERT INTO VIEW:
   Use:You can only insert into updatable views â€” views based on a single table without aggregations, joins, or GROUP BY.
Exampel query:
  First, create a simple view:
    CREATE VIEW sales_employees AS
    SELECT id, first_name, last_name, department, salary, join_date
    FROM employees
    WHERE department = 'Sales';
  
  Now insert into it (make sure values match view structure):
    INSERT INTO sales_employees (id, first_name, last_name, department, salary, join_date)
    VALUES (101, 'Ravi', 'Kumar', 'Sales', 65000.00, '2025-05-02');

5.UPDATE VIEW:
  Use:You can also update data through an updatable view.

Example query:
  UPDATE sales_employees
  SET salary = salary + 5000
  WHERE id = 1;
