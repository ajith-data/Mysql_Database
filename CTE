1. Basic CTE (Common Table Expression)
  A CTE is a temporary result set that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE query. It improves readability and simplifies complex queries.

Example query:
  WITH HighEarners AS (
    SELECT id, first_name, last_name, salary
    FROM employees
    WHERE salary > 80000)

  SELECT * FROM HighEarners;

2.Recursive CTE
  Recursive CTEs are used when you need to work with hierarchical or iterative data. Even though your data isn’t naturally hierarchical (like manager → employee), we can simulate recursion.

Example query:
  WITH RECURSIVE NumberSeries AS (
    SELECT 1 AS num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT num + 1
    FROM NumberSeries
    WHERE num < 10)

  SELECT * FROM NumberSeries;

3.Temporary CTE:
  CTEs can also be used as temporary tables in JOINs or INSERTs.

Example query:
  WITH DeptAvgSalary AS (
    SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department)
  SELECT e.id, e.first_name, e.department, e.salary, d.avg_salary
  FROM employees e
  JOIN DeptAvgSalary d ON e.department = d.department;
