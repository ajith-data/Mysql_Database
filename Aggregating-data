--Aggregation functions are used to perform calculations on multiple rows of a tableâ€™s column and return a single value.

1. COUNT()
  Use: To find how many records exist or match a certain condition.
Example query:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;

2. SUM()
  Use:To find out totals, like total salary or total sales.
Example query:
  SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;

3. AVG()  
  Use: To find out the average salary, average sales, or any other mean value.
Example query:
  SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;

4. MIN()
  Use:To find the lowest salary, earliest joining date.
Example query:
  SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees;

5. MAX()
  Use: To find the highest salary, latest joining date.
Example query:
  SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;

6. GROUP BY
  Use:To perform aggregation on groups, like salary totals per department.
Example query:
  SELECT department, SUM(salary)
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department;

7. HAVING
  Use:To filter results after aggregation (because WHERE cannot be used with aggregated data).
Example query:
  SELECT department, SUM(salary)
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department
  HAVING SUM(salary) > 100000;
