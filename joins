-- INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN, CROSS JOIN, and SELF JOIN.

1. INNER JOIN
Meaning:
  Only matching records from both tables will be returned.
  If there is no match, the row is not shown.

Example query:
  SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.department, d.manager
  FROM employees e
  INNER JOIN departments d
  ON e.department = d.department_name;

2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)
Meaning:
  All records from left table (employees), even if there is no match in right table (departments).
  If no match, right side will be NULL.

Example query:
  SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.department, d.manager
  FROM employees e
  LEFT JOIN departments d
  ON e.department = d.department_name;

3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
Meaning:
  All records from right table (departments), even if there is no match in left table (employees).
  If no match, left side will be NULL.

Example query:
  SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.department, d.manager
  FROM employees e
  RIGHT JOIN departments d
  ON e.department = d.department_name;

4. FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)
Meaning:
  All records from both tables, whether there is a match or not.
  Missing side will have NULL.
  ‚ùóMySQL doesn't support FULL JOIN directly.
  We use a trick by combining LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN with UNION.

Example query:
  SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.department, d.manager
  FROM employees e
  LEFT JOIN departments d
  ON e.department = d.department_name
  UNION
  SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.department, d.manager
  FROM employees e
  RIGHT JOIN departments d
  ON e.department = d.department_name;

5. CROSS JOIN
Meaning:
  All possible combinations between two tables.
  No condition is needed.

Example query:
  SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
  FROM employees e
  CROSS JOIN departments d;

6. SELF JOIN
Meaning:
  Joining a table with itself.
  Useful when you want to compare rows in the same table.

Example query:
  SELECT A.first_name AS Employee1, B.first_name AS Employee2, A.department
  FROM employees A
  INNER JOIN employees B
  ON A.department = B.department
  WHERE A.id < B.id;
