-- subqueries (SELECT, FROM, WHERE) in SQL is very useful because it allows you to build more powerful, flexible, and dynamic queries.

1.subqueries in select
2.subqueries in from 
3.subqueries in where

1.subqueries in select
  USE:To calculate something for each row without writing separate queries.
      To fetch related data from other tables inside your output.
Example query:
    SELECT 
    first_name,
    last_name,
    salary,
    (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees;
    
2.subqueries in from 
  USE:To pre-process or group/filter your data before applying more queries.
      Useful when you want to first summarize then further query that summarized data.
Example query:
    SELECT department, AVG(avg_salary) 
FROM (
    SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department
    ) AS department_avg
    GROUP BY department;

3.subqueries in where
    USE:To filter data based on the results of another query.
        Makes your query dynamic (based on current data).
Example query:
    SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
    FROM employees
    WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
