This project demonstrates a simple Employee Management System using MySQL. It covers basic SQL operations such as:
- SELECT
- INSERT INTO
- UPDATE
- DELETE

1.SELECT
  The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It is one of the most commonly used commands in SQL and is essential for reading or querying data.
Example query:
  select * from employees;

2.INSERT INTO
  The INSERT INTO statement is used to add new records to a table in a database.
Example query:
  Insert into employees values(1, 'Derrick', 'Davis', 'derrick.davis@example.com', 'Sales', 81449.87, '2021-07-28');

3.UPDATE
  The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.
Example query:
  update employees
  set first_name="Eric"
  where id=1;

4.DELETE
  The DELETE statement is used to remove one or more rows from a table.
Example query:
  delete from employees
  where id=3;
